# Rochelle's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a small project to bring everyone up to speed on the kind of work we will be doing during our Bootcamp course. 

It allows everyone to take a basic look at HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. 

We learnt how HTML, CSS and Javascript is all used together to create interactive front end applications whilst using Git for version control.
